# Netflix Data Analysis

The following dataset is from Kaggle and it would be great if you would look into it by clicking the link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows).


You can view the graphs and code [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jayantsogikar/netflix-analysis) if you want to learn and understand what is happening without running the code. Else you can fork and clone the repo to run the notebook on your local kernel.

Special thanks to [Dmitryuarov](https://www.kaggle.com/dmitryuarov) for writing clean and visually appealing code so that I could refer to when in doubt.
